    "text" : "<h1>Reinforcement Learning Glossary of Terms</h1> - **Reinforcement Learning:** The field of AI concerned with deciding which actions a software agent ought to take in each state of an environment so as to maximize a defined cumulative reward signal over time. In RL you think of the world (or at least problem space) as a set of states. These states are snapshots of all the details (data) that are relavent to the agent. The agent is able to take actions, that will result in a change in state of the environment. Notice the level of generality? This allows the concepts of RL to be used on an extremely wide scope of problems. "
